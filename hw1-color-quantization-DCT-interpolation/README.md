1.implementing color quantization using k-means clustering, calculating entropy encoding(entropy encoding; shannon fano's encoding)
2.implementing discrete cosine transform, also after filtering, inverse DCT is provided.
  also, calculate PSNR for each transformation.
3.implemeting nearest-neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation
